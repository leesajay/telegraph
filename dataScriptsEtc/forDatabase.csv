There needs to be wide bike lanes, although north of 57th is good for having bike lanes, they feel narrow and it still doesn't feel entirely safe.  It would be good to see very well defined bike lanes that are separate from traffic (vs. sharrows) and possibly colored like the 40th st sharrows.

In the near term, bicycle usage on Telegraph seems to be increasingly steadily and it is time that the City of Oakland takes steps to ensure a balance between bicycling, pedestrians, mass transit, and cars.  I think cars should be the lowest priority focus, there are too many problems with speeding and aggressive driving along Telegraph.  Perhaps traffic calming measures could be an additional component of the plan.","I think Telegraph is the most important street in Oakland in terms of connectivity between downtown and Berkeley, a variety of different neighborhoods that it passes through, and the businesses it supports.

The stop signs or street lights along the Webster/Shafter route at every block can be difficult for bikes.  If there was a way to provide preference to this route, while stopping cross traffic, this would greatly improve the bike-ability.    If there was a way to designate one of these parallel streets as a bicycle boulevard (similar to those in Berkeley), it would make it easier for bikers and reduce conflicts.

Though I primarily commute by bicycle, one afternoon last spring, I was actually riding in our car with my husband on our way to an appointment. We were driving north on Telegraph Avenue, approaching 41st Street. The car in front of us was driving erratically, sort of floating far right and far left in its lane. I wondered if the driver was drunk and was about to call the police from my cell phone. As we approached the stoplight at 41st, the car in front veered so far to the right that it basically caused a woman bicyclist also approaching that light to brake suddenly and come to a complete stop so that she would not be smushed between the parked cars and this car. I shook my head and assumed that this car wanted to turn right and didn't see this bicyclist and cut her off. But to my surprise, the car does not turn and continues up Telegraph. The bicyclist, sensing this car is dangerous, rides up onto the sidewalk after crossing 41st (which I generally frown upon because it's unfair to pedestrians), but in this case it's a good thing she did, because the next thing we see is that this car continuees to careen in the lane and actually sideswipes the row of parked cars, completely knocking off the side mirror of a large truck. We chased down the car and called the police and gave them the license plate. The driver ended up parking in the Koryo lot and got out: a very elderly woman. I am not even sure if she knew she actually hit a bunch of cars.

Improved signange, lighting, arrival notifications, and shelters are needed for most of the study area. The shelter at SB Telegraph & 22nd or so has vanished completely after damage or vandalism. No physical stop structure NB from that area, either, perhaps owing to sidewalk width. Service is frequent on paper, which is great, but sometimes can get incredibly jammed up, with 3, 4, or even 5 (yes, I've seen it) 1 / 1R buses clumped together, followed by NextBus reporting no 1/1R for upwards of 20-25 minutes. Unacceptable for basically the highest-frequency service corridor AC Transit manages.","I don't bicycle on Telegraph, and you couldn't pay me enough to. It's a road built for cars and no one else, and everyone drives like it. It's too wide, it encourages traffic to go to fast, and there is basically NO visible allowance for non-motorized traffic on the street. It's scary.","If you want this to be a pedestrian-friendly corridor, get rid of the ""push to cross"" buttons at EVERY intersection. Give pedestrians the green light each cycle in just the same way that you do for cars. Continue to improve lighting along the way (the north end in the 40s has those new LEDs that are spiffy and energy-efficient -- keep it up!). Trash bins and benches along the way might also help encourage both foot traffic and foot/bus combination travelers.","I like this. I'm not anti-car -- I own one and I use it, because at times it's incredibly convenient, so I'm very aware of and sympathetic to people who value that feature.   But let's not kid ourselves, either, by pretending that automobile traffic on Telegraph in the study area needs to be any sort of priority for this project. As it stands, automobile traffic is basically the *only* priority for travel in the study area (1R stops with LED arrival time signs aside). Almost any modification made to the corridor is going to be to the detriment of automobile traffic as a result. Any change to this vision statement should at least consider acknowledging it's the (speeding, unsafe, or unaware) automotive traffic that is going to be ""detrimentally"" affected by the improvements made -- and that's just fine.","I hear SF is getting BRT on Van Ness.  *cough, cough*  Seriously, though, look at Melbourne.

Many times as my walk light came on they would start their right turn, giving me a ""you idiot"" look.

Telegraph is the main street of North Oakland and the most direct way for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users to connect between downtown and North Oakland. Cars travel faster than these other modes, so diverting to other streets is less of a hassle. Drivers can choose any one of dozens of north-south traffic lanes connecting downtown to North Oakland, and be relatively indifferent to their route, but for the other modes there is only one Telegraph Ave. As a neighborhood resident I want Telegraph to be a nice place to walk and shop and live my life, but the current car focus makes the street an unpleasant place. Unfortunately, there's no way that it can both continue to be a speed highway and also become a real neighborhood center. Please be more explicit in stating that this project is designed to enhance the public realm and improve the safety, comfort, and ease of pedestrian, bike, and transit access.","The Bay Area doesn't have any great streets. That's why we badly need this project to be well designed. The street I wish Telegraph most resembled is the street that was proposed as part of the full length East Bay Bus Rapid Transit Project. That project would have done a great job of improving biking, walking, and transit, while maintaining reasonable and appropriate levels of car access. Please try to design a project that adds bike lanes now, but which also could accommodate bus-only lanes in the future (when bus lanes may become more politically and financially feasible).","The new intersection at Telegraph and Hawthorne is fine for cars, but a disaster for pedestrians! Please correct this intersection and don't let others end up this way.  Pedestrians used to have two legal (but unmarked) crossings, now they only have one. Crossing from the south to the south of the intersection now requires crossing two intersections, not one. The push button means pedestrians often have to wait an extra cycle to cross. In an area where a lot of people are elderly and/or disabled it is now much more difficult to legal connect from many of the medical buildings to the Oasis Market and other nearby stores."812,United States,Berkeley,CA,94704`,,No/blank,No/blank,Yes,Yes,Yes,A few times per month,ACTBART,,Walking,,,DrivingBikingOther,,6,1,1,6,3,6,,,No Opinion,No Opinion,No Opinion,No Opinion,Yes,TransitWalking,Biking,,Driving,,4,1,2,1,,,,,,,813,United States,Oakland,CA,94610,94043,Yes,No/blank,No/blank,No/blank,No/blank,A few times per week,Driving,BikingWalking,,BART,,ACT,Other,1,6,4,2,2,,I love all the small businesses and art galleries that are connected with that corridor.,I wish it was a lot more bike friendly.

Compare any stretch of Telegraph to the section of Broadway between Grand and Piedmont (which is not amazing, but not bad).

If Telegraph is going to be an artery, then the Temescal should have less traffic control, if it's not, then it should be more obvious to drivers that it's a bad route.","The bus service seems okay, and that's really the only transit to speak of.  Bart is too far off Telegraph everywhere except 12th, 19th, and MacArthur.","I tell my newer cycling friends to avoid Telegraph like the plague.  It's definitely perceived as one of the more dangerous routes between Berkeley and Oakland.  The street quality is terrible through the Temescal and from around 27th on down.  There are no bike lanes in a lot of areas, which makes fast-moving motor vehicle traffic feel entitled to buzz cyclists and honk at us for being on the road at all.  The high speed of motor vehicle traffic makes it difficult to make left turns with traffic at a lot of locations.","Perception of safety is not contiguous along the street.  I know that this is something that you can't really do a huge amount to change.  Compare the Temescal from 51st to 40th.  It gets progressively less walkable as you get closer to 40th.  Ease of crossing is also kind of a problem above 51st on towards Berkeley.  There are too many reasons to J-walk because crossings are so much less frequent, but making more would slow traffic down unacceptably.","Honestly, pedestrians are out in the cold here.  There are specific portions of Telegraph that will work for them, but the street as a whole is not walkable.  It's too spread out.  The reality is that 'pedestrian friendly' Telegraph is just a place where people can park their cars next to their destination.  One of the things I like about Telegraph is that it is spread out, and encompasses such a large area.  It's a different street block by block.  But that makes it unlike a traditional walkable downtown because you have to cover a lot more distance.","As much as I hate to say it, Piedmont does a pretty good job at all the things mentioned here except 'motorist friendly' streets.  It's very walkable for a short distance, it has a good mix of 'consumer' businesses, as opposed to industrial and heavy commercial business like repair shops.  I think that Shattuck up in North Berkeley has a similar 'walkable' feel to it while staying cyclist and motor vehicle friendly.  In San Francisco, Valencia has tried to strike a balance between different transit forms, and I think it's done relatively well.  The bike lanes are wide, and there's a lot of interaction between cyclists, motor vehicles, and pedestrians, but I think that it's relatively safe, as compared to other streets with that kind of volume.

We live in a society where cars dominate, and we need to take extra effort to combat car dependency and walkable neighborhoods. While I think cars need to be able to travel safely along Telegraph, I think through traffic should be discouraged by having one lane of travel in each direction for cars. The other lanes would be used for buses, for bike lanes, and for wider sidewalks.  A good example of this was the Lake Merritt improvement project. While I think the Lake Merritt dam replacement project was a huge step in the right direction, it still left behind a giant street meant for cars. If we really want to reduce car usage, we need to dedicate more resources to non-auto travel. Instead of building a giant road, maybe we could have built improved bus stops or some sort of BRT along that part of the lake (even though it would have been short in length).","I think Glenview is a great example of what Telegraph could be like.

Accessibility and Accommodations for all is prime..it has to be visible and it shouldn't be an argument. Lets help Oakland flourish with pride for their streets and for their overall city..the designs would be from locals...the jobs for locals..that is how the city keeps their community in safety and visibility.1108,United States,Berkeley,CA,94611,94720-3200,No/blank,No/blank,No/blank,No/blank,Yes,A few times per week,DrivingBiking,,,,,,ACTBARTWalkingOther,1,,,1,,,"I do NOT ride my bike on Telegraph - I consider it way too dangerous.  The few times I tried it, I was shocked by the speed of car traffic and the AC transit buses are the worst offenders - I was once forced to jump my bike onto the curb to avoid a an AC bus running me off the road to get to a stop.","I think it's fine as is - just not good for bicycles.  For getting to campus from Oakland, there is a very safe route just a few blocks east - the Hillegass Bike Boulevard route - nice - low traffic - very safe.",Disagree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,No,Walking,,,,DrivingTransitBiking,,,,1,51st to campus - fine for cars - not fine for bikes or pedestrians,,51st to campus - don't do it - crazy dangerous for bikes!,better pedestrian crossing lanes - lighted crosswalks?  Some flashing lights to get motorist's attention,"I would de-emphasize bicycles - there are better options - a bike lane on a thoroughfare with traffic often at 45 mph+ is untenable, in general.   Buses need to learn to look for bikes if this is to continue.",I think it's basically fine for cars - the trouble is making it safer for pedestrian crossing.  Bikes would be smarter to choose the existing bike paths like I mentioned above - College to Forest St to Claremont to Hillegass to Bowditch to campus - very bike safe and just as fast.  I often get to work faster on my bike than when I drive.,
